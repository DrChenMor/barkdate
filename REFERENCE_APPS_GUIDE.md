### **Code Quality Standards:**
- Follow Material 3 design tokens
- Use semantic widget names (PlaydateRequestCard vs GenericCard)
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Include accessibility features (semantics, focus management)
- Write comprehensive widget tests for complex interactions

### **Performance Considerations:**
- Use `const` constructors wherever possible
- Implement proper `dispose()` methods for streams/controllers
- Cache network images and user preferences
- Use `ListView.builder` for dynamic lists
- Implement pagination for large datasets
