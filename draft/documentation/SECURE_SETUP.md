# 🔐 BarkDate Secure Development Setup

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. First Time Setup
```bash
# Your .env file already exists with your API keys
# Just run the app securely:
./quick_start.sh
```

### 2. Alternative Method
```bash
# Load environment and run manually:
source .env
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="$GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### ✅ What's Protected:
- ✅ `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (never gets committed)
- ✅ API keys are loaded from environment variables
- ✅ Template file (`.env.example`) shows structure without real keys
- ✅ Scripts handle missing keys gracefully

### 🔍 How to Verify Security:
```bash
# Check that .env is ignored by git:
git status

# Verify .env won't be added accidentally:
git add .env  # This should fail or be ignored
```

## 📝 Files Created:

1. **`.env.example`** - Template file (safe to commit)
2. **`quick_start.sh`** - Simple launcher script  
3. **`run_dev.sh`** - Full development script with checks
4. **Updated `.gitignore`** - Protects sensitive files

## 🔧 How It Works:

1. **Environment Variables**: Your API keys stay in `.env` (never committed)
2. **Build-time Injection**: Keys are injected when running the app
3. **Template System**: Other developers can copy `.env.example` to `.env`
4. **Script Automation**: Easy launching with `./quick_start.sh`

## 🚨 Security Checklist:

- ✅ `.env` file exists locally
- ✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore`  
- ✅ `.env.example` template created
- ✅ Real API keys only in `.env` (not in code)
- ✅ Scripts load environment variables
- ✅ HTML template uses placeholders

## 🎯 Result:

Your API keys are now secure! They exist only on your machine and are loaded at runtime. Anyone who clones your repo will need to create their own `.env` file with their own API keys.

Perfect for both development and production deployment! 🔒✨
