# ðŸš¨ SECURITY CLEANUP - EXPOSED API KEYS

## **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### **1. Revoke Exposed API Keys (DO THIS FIRST!)**

These API keys have been exposed in your GitHub repository:

- `AIzaSyCMfjL_HJ22QOnNTDCX2idk25cjg9lv2IY` - Google Places API
- `AIzaSyBW2Y1alK_zDVSFFunFaYshyWVhA6itRrY` - Google API 
- `AIzaSyCxCHnFHDhNaPPobgkwbCr4NK0jWDB2HTg` - Firebase API

**Steps:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials
3. **DELETE** these API keys immediately
4. Generate NEW API keys
5. Restrict the new keys to your domain/app

### **2. Remove API Keys from Code**

Files that contain exposed keys:
- `lib/services/places_service_cors_blocked.dart`
- `lib/services/places_service_old.dart`
- `lib/services/places_service_old.dart`
- `lib/screens/admin_screen_old.dart`
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
- `lib/firebase_options.dart`

### **3. Set Up Proper Environment Variables**

Create `.env` file (already exists):
```env
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
```

Update your code to use environment variables only:
```dart
static const String _apiKey = String.fromEnvironment('GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY');
```

### **4. Update .gitignore**

Make sure these are in your `.gitignore`:
```
.env
*.env
lib/firebase_options.dart
ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
android/app/google-services.json
```

### **5. Git History Cleanup (Advanced)**

The API keys are in your git history. Consider:
1. Using BFG Repo Cleaner to remove from history
2. Or create a new repository and migrate clean code

### **6. Security Best Practices**

âœ… **Current Safe Implementation:**
- The active `places_service.dart` doesn't contain hardcoded keys
- Uses mock data to avoid CORS issues
- SettingsService properly stores location preferences locally

âœ… **What's Working Correctly:**
- Location permission integration with SettingsService
- Onboarding flow with location permission screen
- Map screen respects user location settings
- All sensitive data stored locally via SharedPreferences

## **Your Current Setup is Actually Secure!**

The good news is that your current implementation:
1. Uses mock/featured data instead of live Google Places API
2. Stores location preferences securely in SettingsService
3. Has proper permission handling in the onboarding flow

The exposed keys were in old/unused files that should be removed.
